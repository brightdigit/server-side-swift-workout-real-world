# The Power of Full Stack Swift

As has been stated there's a lot of benefit to building a Full Stack Swift app. 

## Unified Language Ecosystem

We have one language for passing models and sharing business logic across devices and servers.


## Type Safety Across the Stack

We can take advantage of the safety Swift has to offer for developer.


## Performance Benefits

There's plenty of benefits when it comes to performance especially when going with a more budget-friendly host. 


## Apple's Ecosystem Integration

Along with sharing server-side code, we have the ability to port our app to all of Apple's devices easily.


## Growing Server-Side Swift Community




## Simplified Deployment and Scaling

Server-Side Swift is friendly to services like Heroku but importantly Docker which is universally accepted and well supported.

## Developer Productivity

Being able to easily debug and analyze server-side and device side code via Xcode is a huge boost to developer productivity.
